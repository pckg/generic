# each packet may provide multiple functionalitites
# when publishing (or activating) vendor we need to define which files needs to be altered:
#  - composer packages
#  - yarn / npm packages
#  - css, js, less assets
#  - migrations
#  - config changes
#  - providers
#
# first, we need to require package
# $ composer require pckg/generic
#
# then we want to use some things, so for example, when user wants to enable dynamic backend he runs:
# $ php console vendor:activate vendor/pckg/generic dynamicBackend
#
# but first we need to define what will we publish :)
